    "# Generate charts for trading analysis using Historical Pricing API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Analysis for intraday trading is one of the basic approaches to help you choose the planning of ventures. Basically, users can use the intraday or end-of-day pricing data to generate charts such as the CandleStick. And then, they can review the stock price' trend and make decisions using their own mehtod or algorithm. Typically, LSEG Workspace and Eikon Desktop users also provide access to this information, and it also provides a user interface to display multiple types of Charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a specific requirement from a customer who did not use Eikon or LSEG Workspace. They need to build their own stand-alone application or generate the charts on their application using data from LSEG. The user is looking for the source of data or service to provide the intraday data for them in the REST API format. So they can integrate the service with their app. \n",
    "\n",
    "To support the requirement client can use REST API provided by [Data Platform](https://developers.lseg.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-apis) that basically provides simple web-based API access to a broad range of content provided by LSEG. It can retrieve data such as News, ESG, Symbology, Streaming Price, and Historical Pricing. Users can get the intraday from the Historical Pricing service and then pass the data to any libraries that provided functionality to generate Charts. To help API users access content easier, LSEG also provides the LSEG Data Platform Libraries that provide a set of uniform interfaces providing the developer access to the Data Platform. We are currently providing an LSEG Data Platform Libraries for Python, TypeScript and .NET users. A general user and data scientists can leverage the library's functionality to retrieve data from the service, which basically provides the original response message from the service in JSON tabular format. The LSEG Data Library for Python will then convert the JSON tabular format to the pandas dataframe so that the user does not need to handle a JSON message and convert it manually. The user can use the dataframe with libraries such as mathplotlib and mplfinance to display the Charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I will show you how to use the LSEG Data Library for Python, request the intraday data from the Historical Pricing service, and then generate basic charts such as the Candle Stick charts. Basically, the [Japanese candlestick chart](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/) commonly used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. It's popular in finance, and some technical analysis strategies use them to make trading decisions, depending on the candles' shape, color, and position."

    "## Generate Renko Chart\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on information from [the investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renkochart.asp), a Renko chart is a type of chart, developed by the Japanese, that is built using price movement rather than both price and standardized time intervals like most charts are. It is thought to be named after the Japanese word for bricks, \"renga,\" since the chart looks like a series of bricks. A new brick is created when the price moves a specified price amount, and each block is positioned at a 45-degree angle (up or down) to the prior brick. An up brick is typically colored white or green, while a down brick is typically colored black or red[[7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renkochart.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Renko charts filter out noise and help traders to more clearly see the trend, since all movements that are smaller than the box size are filtered out.Renko charts typically only use closing prices based on the chart time frame chosen. For example, if using a weekly time frame, then weekly closing prices will be used to construct the bricks[[7]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renkochart.asp)."

    "This article explains users' alternate choices to retrieve such kind of the End of Day price or intraday datatime series data from the LSEG Data Libaray for Python. This article provides a sample code to use the LSEG Data Library for python to retrieve the Historical Pricing service, and then shows how to utilize the data with the 3rd party library such as the mplfinance to plot charts like the CandleStick, OHLC, and Renko chart for stock price technical analysis. With the library, users can specify a different kind of interval and adjustment behavior to retrieve more specific data and visualize the data on various charts. They can then use the charts to identify trading opportunities in price trends and patterns seen on charts. \n",
